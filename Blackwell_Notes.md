# Notes

1. Look up "helots" and give one or two sentences about this.k

1. Background: Some Etruscans tried to seize territory in the Aegean, got kicked out of by the Athenians, and became refugees. They offered their services to the Spartans, who were at war with the helots.

1. The fact that the Spartans made them 2nd-class citizens, seems to have made the Spartans paranoid. So when some Etruscans had some of meeting…

1. Mention that the second part of the essay seems to go off on a tangent, about how the Etruscans became refugees a second time.

1. Many more citations in the general Etruscan parts!!

1. Re-order: General Etruscan stuff --> Plutarch's story. "The Etruscans were…" Make the transition with something like "Plutarch's anecdote focuses on one group of Etruscans who became refugees…"

1. Etruscans are generally  thought of as Italians. Say something about how they end up in Greece.

1. If you can find a source that says cross-dresses was generally looked down on, by all means use that. The trick wouldn't work if gender weren't generally signalled by clothing. Or, if you can find a source that describes clothing, that might help the reader visualize what happened.

1. You can focus the conclusion even more on the symmetry of men and women _in Plutarch's account_.
