## Plutarch

Mestrius Plutarch was born in the Greek city of Chaeronea sometime between 120 CE and 50CE. He eventually became a Roman citizen and spent a large portion of his life as a priest at Delphi. He was well known for his collection of written works, referred to as Moralia. Plutarch wrote a lot of his Moralia during the last 20 years of his life, but much of his work has been lost. His most famous work, *Parallel Lives*, compares the lives and accomplishments of great men. (Russel D., 2005) His collection of essays, *On the Bravery of Women* described impressive stories of women throughout the ancient world. This work argues that women are just as worthy of respect and admiration as men.

## The Etruscan Women

In his collection of stories, Roman author Plutarch describes the Etruscan women. His account not only admires their bravery, but also hints at their elevated position within Etruscan society.

The Etruscans aligned with the Spartans in "the War with the Helots" and contributed to the Spartan victory. In return, the Etruscans were given citizenship, but were not allowed to hold office. The Spartans began to suspect that the Etruscans were planning some sort of revolt and imprisoned the Etruscan men. The Etruscan women asked to visit their husbands and once inside switched garments with the men. This allowed the men to walk out of the prison unsuspected while the women stayed behind dressed as their husbands. The Etruscan men eventually negotiated with the Spartans to free their wives.

In the ancient world, Etruscan women were seen as promiscuous. This conception was in part due to their freedom and relative equality compared to women in other notable ancient societies, such as Athens and Sparta.

They had names beyond their husbands and certain legal rights including property ownership if there was no surviving male. Etruscan women held great status within the family. Titles on Etruscan tombs were written in the form of "Son of (Father) and (Mother)." This may have been due to the Etruscan women's role in raising children. Mothers were very hands on with their children and even breastfed their infants. Although in modern culture the stereotypical maternal role in parenting is viewed as an inequality, raising children was a freedom that many women in similar societies of the ancient era lacked.

Etruscan women were even allowed to attend sporting events and ride horses, which was still seen as unbecoming for a lady in early 20th century European societies. There are statues depicting women wrestling and dancing, which could just be artistic representation but may provide evidence of women competing in sporting events.

The prison break organized by the Etruscan women reflects the importance of bravery in Etruscan society, specifically the bravery of women. The story later addresses the importance of the goddess Artemis to the Etruscans. Artemis is known as the goddess of the hunt and protector of women. The Etruscan's admiration of the bow and arrow adorned goddess reinforces the position of the woman in Etruscan society and explains the women's willingness to sacrifice themselves in order to save their husbands.

Men dressing as women is generally shown in a negative context within Greek mythology. For example, in the Tales of Odysseus, Achilles dresses as a woman to evade war and is publicly shamed for his lack of courage. The fact that the Etruscan men would dress in women's clothing and allow their wives to take their place in captivity shows the position of women in Etruscan society.

The story of the Etruscan women is unique in that the women are essentially serving as the protectors of their husbands. The image of the Etruscan women trading clothing with their husbands symbolizes the assumption of this role. The protector role was very uncommon of women in the ancient world and is heavily debated even in modern society.

## Conclusion

Although they enjoyed many freedoms, Etruscan women were ultimately beneath men in the social hierarchy. They were not equal to men, but Etruscan women held position within the community, separating them from their ancient counterparts.
Plutarch does not tell the story of the Etruscan women to portray women as above men, but to describe a partnership between them. The women free the men from prison and the men eventually return and do the same. The women use their cunning to fight against the Spartans which allows the men to use their strength to fight against the Spartans. Two separate attributes of men and women are shown, but one is not put above the other. Plutarch is suggesting that women and men are both worthy of praise in their own unique ways.
